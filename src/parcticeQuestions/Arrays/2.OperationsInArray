search :
Searching in an array involves checking each element to see if it matches the target value. Here are examples of linear search and binary search in Java.

Linear Search
Linear search is a simple method that works for both sorted and unsorted arrays. It checks each element one by one.

Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient method but requires the array to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Deletion:
in Java, there is no direct way to delete an element from an array because arrays have a fixed size once they are created. However, you can achieve the effect of "deleting" an element by creating a new array that does not include the element you want to remove
==> 2 ways
1) Approach 1: Create a New Array
   Identify the element to be removed.
   Create a new array of size original length - 1.
   Copy all elements except the one to be removed into the new array.

2) Approach 2: Using ArrayList
   Alternatively, you can use an ArrayList, which provides a more flexible way to handle collections of objects. ArrayList allows dynamic resizing and provides a convenient remove method.

updating:
1)  update directly using index number that we get from user

insertion:

Inserting an element into an array in Java requires creating a new array if the array is not dynamic (like Java's built-in arrays). Java arrays have fixed size, so you cannot directly add elements to them like you can with a dynamic data structure such as ArrayList. Instead, you must create a new array that is larger and copy the elements from the old array to the new one, with the new element inserted in the desired position.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide and example to illustrate how to insert an element into an array:

Step-by-Step Guide
Declare and Initialize the Original Array: Create and populate the original array.
Create a New Array: Make a new array that is one element larger than the original array.
Copy Elements and Insert the New Element: Copy the elements from the original array to the new array, inserting the new element at the specified index.
Print the New Array: Optionally, print the new array to verify the insertion.
