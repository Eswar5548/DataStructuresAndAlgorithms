intersection of 2 unsorted arrays
union of 2 unsorted arrays

==============================================

1)intersection of 2 unsorted arrays
-->Naive solution: we have to traverse array1 in array2 and chck if elements is presnet print or else dont print
-->Efficient Solution using hashmap: we have to traverse array1 and store in hashset and taverse now array2 and check each elemnt is present in hashset of present print else leave it

2)union of 2 unsorted array
--> travese an array1 and store in hashset and traverse array2 now and store in hashset
